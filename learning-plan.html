        <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values
        involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2><br>

<p>One situation where I had to make an ethical decision was when I worked at a retail store and a customer
 tried to return a used item without a receipt. While the store policy allowed for returns without receipts,
  it was clear that the item had been worn and was not in its original condition. I had to weigh up the value
  s of honesty, fairness, and the importance of following company policies. After considering these values,
   I decided to politely explain to the customer that we could not accept the return as it was against store
    policy. Looking back on the decision, I feel that I made the right choice as it was important to uphold 
    the store's policies and maintain fairness for all customers.<p><br>






<br><h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2><br>
<p>Since my mother is a teacher, she has instilled in me a lifelong passion for exploring new activities,
 subjects, and interests that I may not have previously considered. This upbringing has played a significant
  role in shaping my identity as someone who constantly craves new experiences and knowledge acquisition.</p>





<br><h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2><br>
<p>it comes to my strengths, I believe that my inquisitive nature and tenacity are my two greatest assets.
 Throughout my personal and professional development, my curiosity has been a constant source of motivation and learning. I have an insatiable desire to understand how things work, which has driven me to explore diverse subjects and acquire knowledge. Whether it's learning a new skill or tackling a complex problem, my curiosity fuels my passion for discovery.
Moreover, I attribute much of my success to my persistence. When faced with challenges, 
I am not easily discouraged, and I work hard to overcome obstacles and achieve my goals. This trait has 
enabled me to persevere through difficult situations, learn from my failures, and continuously improve 
myself. In short, my curiosity and persistence are intertwined and help me navigate through life's 
challenges with resilience and an open mind.</p>






<br><h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your
 learning journey?</h2><br>
<p>My ADHD and Autism diagnoses present considerable hurdles to my learning and career growth. These 
conditions impede my ability to concentrate and absorb information efficiently, and I require a supportive 
environment to enhance my focus and productivity. As such, these challenges have a significant impact on my
 learning journey, serving as limiting factors that hinder my progress.</p>




<br><h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or 
tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
 strategies you would try now and why.</h2><br>
<p> An example of when I faced resistance while working with others was during a group project in college. I wanted to delegate tasks and set deadlines, but some group members were not interested in following through or were resistant to taking on specific tasks.
To address the tension, I held a group meeting to discuss each member's strengths and weaknesses and allocated tasks accordingly. I also set clear deadlines and regularly checked in with everyone's progress. While this strategy helped to some extent, there was still some tension and procrastination from a few group members.
Looking back, I think I could have tried to understand the underlying reasons for the resistance and worked
 with the group members to find solutions that would work.</p>
