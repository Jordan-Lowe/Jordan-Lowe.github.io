            <h2>Three things I have learned about myself, and my ego.</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout life, we all face a multitude of challenges, both internal and external, that test our resilience and perseverance. 
                    One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is that no matter what problems I encounter, I can always find a way to overcome them. 
                    By facing my difficulties head-on and seeking out solutions, I have discovered a strength within myself that I never knew existed.<br>

                    <br>In addition to problem-solving, I have also found that sticking to a consistent learning plan has greatly benefited my personal growth.
                     Daily meditation, in particular, has allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of myself, my actions, and their impact on those around me.
                    By taking the time to reflect and be mindful, I have been able to identify both positive and negative aspects of my behavior and make changes 
                    accordingly.<br>

                    Another valuable lesson I have learned is the importance of self-acceptance. It can be easy to become fixated on our flaws and shortcomings, 
                    but by embracing all aspects of ourselves, we open ourselves up to personal growth and development. By striving to improve ourselves in a 
                    positive and beneficial way, rather than simply trying to boost our ego or self-image, we can achieve true personal growth and become the 
                    best version of ourselves.

            <h2>What has surprised me the most about core learning.</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this course, I have been taken aback by several aspects of core learning. One of the most significant revelations has been the value of 
                    human skills in a programmer's workspace as well as in our daily lives. Moreover, when assigned my first looping and listening task, I was initially taken 
                    aback. Nonetheless, I gradually found myself enjoying it, even though it was challenging at first. I learned how valuable listening is as a tool for 
                    communication.

            <h3>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
            <p>
                Values, empathy, and self-awareness are essential elements in learning and programming, as they can help developers create better software and 
                make more ethical decisions.<br>

            <br>Values are important in programming because they provide a framework for decision-making and behavior. In software development, values such as 
            honesty, integrity, and accountability are crucial in building reliable and trustworthy software. By understanding and adopting these values, 
            programmers can create software that aligns with their personal beliefs and societal expectations.<br>

            <br>Empathy is another critical element in programming, as it allows developers to understand the perspectives and needs of users and stakeholders. 
            By empathizing with users, developers can create software that is more user-friendly and solves real-world problems. Empathy also plays a role in 
            ethical decision-making, as it helps developers consider the potential impact of their actions on others.<br>

            <br>Self-awareness is the ability to recognize one's thoughts, feelings, and actions. In programming, self-awareness can help developers identify their
             strengths and weaknesses, and seek opportunities for growth and improvement. By being self-aware, programmers can also better understand their 
             biases and limitations, and work to overcome them. This can lead to more effective problem-solving and a better overall development process.

            <h3>The challening aspect's of core learning. </h3>
            <p>
                During my time attending foundations, I faced some challenging aspects in my core learning. One of the most significant hurdles I encountered 
                was learning how to loop and listen correctly, which required a great deal of effort and attention. At the start of every session, I found it 
                challenging to get the hang of it, but as time passed, I and my partner grew more comfortable listening and looping to each other, and I began 
                to find these core sessions enjoyable.<<br>

                <br>Another difficulty I faced in my core learning was learning how to reflect on myself and my mistakes, both in programming and in real life. 
                I initially struggled to examine my ego and engage in meaningful self-reflection. However, after practicing daily meditation, I noticed that 
                I began reflecting on some of my past mistakes and planning ways to fix or resolve issues. As a result, I found myself becoming more self-aware
                , and this helped me improve my programming skills and overall well-being.

            <h2>Why I think Devacademy is investing this much time into core learning.</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several reasons why Devacademy invests so much time and effort in teaching core learning. One of them is to foster our human 
                    skills and emotional intelligence, which have numerous benefits both in the workplace and in real life.

                    students develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, which are crucial for success in the web 
                    development industry.<br>
                    
                    <br>By prioritizing core learning in their curriculum, Devacademy can equip students with the knowledge and skills they 
                    need to become successful developers who can adapt to changes in technology and the industry.

            <h2>My opinions of if I feel that core study was a waste of time.</h2>
            <p>
                Learning core theory can have multiple benefits, and it is essential to reflect on how this knowledge can positively impact our lives. Despite 
                initial doubts, I firmly believe that dedicating time to studying core theories was not a waste of time. Firstly, it provided me with a deeper 
                understanding of emotional intelligence, which has been crucial in my personal and professional relationships.<br>
                I have become more aware of my emotions and how they affect my behavior and interactions with others. Secondly, learning about human skills has 
                helped me recognize the importance of empathy, respect, and teamwork. These skills are essential in any workplace and can be applied in all areas
                 of life. Thirdly, developing my communication and listening skills has allowed me to express myself better, understand others' perspectives, and 
                 avoid conflicts.<br> Lastly, my proudest achievement is learning to reflect on myself and my connections with others, which I achieved through 
                 meditation. Meditation has allowed me to calm my mind and reflect on my emotions, thoughts, and actions, leading to personal growth and improved 
                 relationships.<br>

                In conclusion, learning core theories has provided me with a valuable set of skills and knowledge that has positively impacted my personal 
                and professional life.
