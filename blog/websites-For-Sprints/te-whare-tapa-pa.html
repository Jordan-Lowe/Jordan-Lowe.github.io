            <h3>Taha Hinengaro</h3>
                <li>Tahe Hinengaro meaning</li>
                    <p>Taha Hinengaro is a concept that originates from the Māori culture of New Zealand and refers to the dimension of 
                        emotional and mental well-being. In Māori culture, health and well-being are seen as holistic, encompassing the 
                        physical, spiritual, social, and mental aspects of a person's life. Taha Hinengaro specifically refers to the mind, 
                        thoughts, and emotions of an individual.

                        Taha Hinengaro is closely linked to the concept of "whakapapa," which refers to the interconnectedness of all things in
                         the universe. In this context, emotional and mental well-being is seen as being intimately connected to a person's 
                         sense of identity, sense of purpose, and connection to their ancestors and the natural world.
                        
                        Taha Hinengaro encompasses a wide range of mental states, from feeling calm and content to experiencing anxiety, 
                        depression, and other forms of distress. It is believed that a person's emotional and mental state can be influenced 
                        by a range of factors, including their relationships, environment, cultural background, and life experiences.
                        
                        Overall, the concept of Taha Hinengaro emphasizes the importance of emotional and mental well-being as a key component 
                        of overall health and wellness. It highlights the need for individuals to take care of their mental health and seek 
                        support when needed to maintain balance and harmony in their lives.
                    </p>
                <li>How I will use Tahe Hinengaro in my wellbeing plan</li>
                    <p> My biggest goal to incorporate Tahe Hinengaro into my wellbeing plan would be to spend 20 minutes reading a book I am intrested
                        in for entertainment purpose. I will have 20 minutes relaxing and enjoying myself so I have the mental energy to take on the next day
                        and appericiate the day I just had.

                    themselves, others, and the wider world. It involves a sense of purpose and meaning in life, as well as a connection to one's 
                    cultural and spiritual beliefs, practices, and traditions.

                    For Maori, spirituality is an integral part of their culture and identity, and Taha Wairua is considered essential for achieving 
                    overall wellbeing. It is believed that a strong and healthy spirit is necessary to maintain balance and harmony within oneself,

            <li>How I will incorporate Taha Wairua</li>
                <p> I plan to incorporate Taha Wairua into my wellbeing plan by attending the Yoga lessons provied at Dev Academy. I have never 
                    tried Yoga before. But after researching Yoga while looking into Taha Wairua I have seen their are many great benefits and am now exited 
                    to try it.

            <h3>Whenua</h3>
              <li>What is Whenua</li>
                <p>Whenua is a Maori term that encompasses a deep sense of connection to the land and the environment. 
                    It is not just a physical connection but also a spiritual and cultural connection that the Maori people have with the natural world.

                    Whenua is a term that describes the interdependence of all things in the environment, including the land, water, plants, animals, and 
                    people. It acknowledges that the land is not just a resource to be exploited but also a source of spiritual nourishment and cultural 
                    identity.
                    
                    For the Maori people, the whenua is a living entity with its own mana, or power. It is seen as the foundation of all life and the source 
                    of all sustenance. The Maori people have a deep respect for the whenua and have developed a complex set of customs and practices to ensure 
                    its protection and preservation.
                </p>
            <li>How I will incorporate Whenua</li>
                <p>My goal with incorporating Whenua into my wellbeing plan is to make sure I go for a walk or hike in nature at least once 
                    every two weeks.
