            <h2>Were blocked on a simple problem</h2>
                <li>What was the problem</li>
                    <p>I was stuck on the javascript-kata gradebook question number 4. The goal was to make a new function that would add a score
                        to a previous array using the push function in Javascript.
                    </p>
                <li>What problem solving techniques I used.</li>
                    <p> I used Pseudo-code, Console logging, google, trial and error, and asking my friends for help.
                    </p>
                <li>How I felt throughout the process.</li>
                    <p>I was happy and frustrated at the same time. My friend has previously completed this course so he was able to point out 
                        the errors I was making in a way that made me happy and passionate to continue improving.
                    </p>
                <li>What I learned</li>
                    <p>I learned there are many process to overcome a problem I may encounter while coding or in real life. There are many solution
                        to a problem and you should attempt all before giving up on the problem.

            <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
                <li>What was the problem</li>
                    <p> Understanding the map() method in Javascript, and how to correctly apply it and use it.
                    </p>
                <li>What problem solving techniques I used.</li>
                    <p> I used many methods to gain a clear understanding of the map method, such as google, youtube videos, W3 school. 
                        But I found that using the map() method as one of my research topics helped me to gain the clearest understanding.
                    </p>
                <li>How I felt throughout</li>
                    <p>I felt frustrated as it was only one method out of many that I will be required to learn and gain a clear understanding of.
                        It was only after I felt that I had done enough research and implementation that I was able to understand that its fine 
                        to not understand something without putting in the effort to research it.

            <h2>How confident I am with these following problem-solving techniques.</h2>  
                <li>Pseudo-code</li>
                    <p>I am very confident with Pseudocode as being able to write down fake code and work from there gives me clear visual understanding
                        of what I am doing.
                    </p>        
                <li>Trying something</li>
                    <p>Trying something is the problem-solving method I use the most. Through multiple attempts and errors I am able to gain 
                        more understanding of the topic or question.
                    </p>
                <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                    <p>I find the rubber ducky method very effective as it makes me question my codes purpose or use. But I realize I need to put more 
                        effort into applying that method.
                    </p>
                <li>Reading error messages</li>
                    <p>
                        If I come across an error message I am less confident in being able to understand what the error message is portraying or saying is wrong.
                        I need to invest more time in understand what exactly an error message means.
                    </p>
                <li>console.logging</li>
                    <p>
                        I use console.logging as one of my main sources of problem solving as it gives me a clear visual image of what my code 
                        is doing.
                    </p>
                <li>Asking peers for help</li>
                    <p>I struggle with asking peers for help more than any other problem-solving method. This is because its something
                        I have always struggled to do.  I realize this is something to work on as it plays a vital role in making sure 
                        the team I am in is successful.
                    </p>
                <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                    <p>
                        I struggle asking coaches for help but I am improving on it now. I am becoming more frequent in Discord and am asking questions
                        in the daily tutorial videos.

            <h3>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>
              <li>In week 3 with the Javascript intro exercises</li>
                <p>
                    I was unable to get the npm run test page loading correctly. I was hesitant to ask for help and tryed completing all the 
                    test questions by console logging everything instead of asking for help. I now realize after this weeks Core and Tech
                    exercises this was something I should of asked my peers or mentors for help with. I wish I could go back and change my 
                    mindest on how I should of approached solving that problem.
