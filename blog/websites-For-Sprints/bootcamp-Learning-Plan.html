            <h2>What my long term goal or career pathway is.</h2>
            <p> 
                As an aspiring web designer, my ultimate objective is to acquire a comprehensive set of skills and knowledge in web development that will enable me to 
                create professional, visually appealing, and functional websites for businesses and individuals alike. My long-term vision is to utilize these 
                skills to assist small businesses and friends in building an online presence and effectively reaching out to their target audience.<br>

                <br>I have no destination in mind for when I finish this course but I would love to jump straight into the industry once I have finished this course.

            <h2>what my biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp may be</h2>
            <p>
                As I prepare to start my journey at the bootcamp, I am aware that the biggest non-technical challenge I will face is the intense workload that 
                lies ahead. However, I have thought through this challenge and put in place several strategies to ensure that I stay on top of my game.<br>

                To start with, I have created a detailed time schedule that will help me keep track of my assignments, deadlines, and progress. 
                This schedule will help me prioritize my tasks and allocate enough time to each of them, ensuring that I don't fall behind. Additionally, 
                by breaking down the workload into manageable chunks, I will be able to avoid feeling overwhelmed and stay motivated throughout the program.<br>
                
                In addition to the time schedule, I have also reached out to my friends and family for support. I have shared my goals with them, and they have 
                promised to be there for me whenever I need them. Whether it's for emotional support, practical assistance with errands or chores, or even just 
                a listening ear, I know that I can count on them to be there for me outside of bootcamp.<br>
                
                Overall, while I know that the upcoming bootcamp will be challenging, I am confident that I have the tools and resources I need to overcome 
                these challenges.

           <h2>What my biggest strength and limitation may be in Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                As I reflect on my strengths and limitations while entering bootcamp, I am confident that my tenacity will continue to be my biggest asset. 
                The intensive workload and stressful environment can be overwhelming, but my perseverance and determination to succeed will push me to keep 
                going. Furthermore, I have noticed a significant improvement in my problem-solving skills throughout my time in foundations. I have learned to 
                analyze situations critically and find effective solutions, which will be crucial in navigating the challenges of bootcamp.<br>

                <br>In addition to my tenacity and problem-solving skills, I have also developed more efficient and positive ways to cope with my ADHD and 
                Autism through foundations. While these conditions may still present challenges, I have learned to manage my symptoms more effectively and 
                minimize their impact on my daily life. I have also gained a deeper understanding of my strengths and limitations, which will help me to work 
                more effectively with my peers and instructors.

                Despite my continued efforts to manage my conditions, I recognize that they may still present obstacles for me in bootcamp. However, 
                I am confident that the skills and strategies I have learned in foundations will help me to overcome these challenges and achieve my goals. 
                With my tenacity, problem-solving abilities, and improved coping mechanisms, I am ready to take on the rigorous demands of bootcamp and emerge 
                as a successful professional in my field.

            <h2>What humans skills I want to develop in Devacademy</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is a vital skill that helps individuals to understand and manage their emotions effectively, empathize with others, 
                communicate more effectively, and build stronger relationships. As a result, it is an essential skill that can significantly impact personal and 
                professional success. Therefore, I believe that improving my emotional intelligence at DevAcademy would be highly beneficial to me, as it will enable me 
                to develop a more profound understanding of how to manage my emotions and respond to the emotions of others more appropriately.<br>

                <br>By investing time and effort in improving my emotional intelligence, I aim to develop a more robust and versatile skillset that will enable 
                me to build stronger relationships with colleagues and clients, communicate more effectively, and better understand why people might be 
                experiencing certain emotions or challenges. Additionally, by cultivating my emotional intelligence, I can enhance my problem-solving skills, 
                decision-making abilities, and leadership capabilities, making me a more effective and valuable team member. Ultimately, improving my emotional
                 intelligence at DevAcademy is not only beneficial to my personal and professional growth but also contributes to creating a more positive and
                 collaborative work environment.

            <h3>Expectations of myself in Bootcamp</h3>
            <p>
                As a dedicated and motivated student in Bootcamp, I have set high expectations for myself. I hold myself accountable for my own success 
                and believe that I have the potential to achieve great things. Therefore, I am committed to applying the same expectations that I have for 
                other students to myself.<br>

                <br>One of the most important goals that I have set for myself is to find confidence in asking for help when I need it. I understand that 
                learning new skills can be challenging, and I am not afraid to admit when I need assistance. To achieve this, I will actively seek out 
                opportunities to ask questions and engage with the teaching team and other students. Specifically, I will make it a priority to ask at 
                least one question every day of bootcamp, regardless of whether or not I feel stuck.<br>

                In addition to asking for help, I am also committed to following the time schedule that I have set for myself. 
                I recognize that falling behind in work can be detrimental to my success, so I will prioritize staying on track and completing assignments on 
                time. To accomplish this, I will make a concerted effort to plan my schedule in advance, break down tasks into manageable steps, and establish 
                clear goals for each day.<br>

                Ultimately, my expectations for myself in Bootcamp reflect my desire to grow and learn as much as possible. I am confident in my abilities 
                and believe that with hard work and dedication, I can achieve my goals and succeed in this program.<br>
