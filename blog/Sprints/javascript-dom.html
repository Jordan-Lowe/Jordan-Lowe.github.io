            <h2>Functions and why they are helpful</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, functions are a fundamental programming concept that allow a programmer to encapsulate a set of instructions and 
              execute them as many times as needed. Functions in JavaScript are defined using the "function" keyword, followed by a name and a 
              set of parentheses that may include parameters. The function body is enclosed in curly braces and contains the set of instructions 
              that define the function's behavior.

              Functions are helpful in JavaScript for several reasons:
              
              <li>Reusability:</li>
              <p>Functions allow a programmer to write a block of code once and use it multiple times throughout the program, without
               having to repeat the code.</p>
              
              <li>Modularity:</li>
              <p>Functions can be written and tested independently of the main program, which makes code easier to read, understand, 
              and maintain. They also help break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.</p>
              
              <li>Abstraction:</li> 
              <p>Functions allow a programmer to create abstractions that hide the complexity of the underlying code. This makes it
              easier to use and understand the function without having to know the details of how it works.</p>
              
              <li>Parameterization:</li> 
              <p>can accept arguments or parameters, which allows a programmer to customize the behavior of the function 
              based on the specific needs of the program.</p>
              
              In summary, functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript that allow a programmer to write more efficient and maintainable code by 
              encapsulating sets of instructions and making them reusable and modular.</p>

            <h2>Accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, arrays and objects are both used to store and organize data, but they have some key differences in how you access
              that data.<br>

              Arrays are ordered lists of values, typically of the same data type, that you access using numerical indexes. Each value in an 
              array is assigned a numeric index, starting with 0 for the first value.<br> To access a specific value in an array, you use its index 
              by enclosing the index in square brackets following the array variable name.<br>
              
              Objects, on the other hand, store key-value pairs, where each key represents a unique identifier for a value. You access data in 
              objects using the key instead of an index. To access a specific value in an object, you use the key enclosed in square brackets or 
              using the dot notation (if the key name is a valid identifier).<br>
              
              In summary, arrays use numerical indexes to access data in an ordered list, while objects use keys to access data in an unordered 
              collection of key-value pairs.</p>

            <h3>Explanation of Control flow and Loops</h3>
            <p>Control flow is the order in which instructions are executed in a program. It allows the program to make decisions and execute certain blocks 
              of code based on conditions.

              A simple example of control flow in everyday life is making breakfast. Let's say you want to make a bowl of cereal with milk. The control 
              flow would be:</p>
              
              <ol>
                <li>Pour cereal into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Decide if you want to add any toppings (e.g. fruit, nuts).</li>
                <li>yes, add the toppings.</li>
                <li>Pour milk over the cereal.</li>
                <li>Decide if you want to eat the cereal right away or let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>If you want to let it sit, wait a few minutes before eating.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your cereal!</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In this example, the control flow is determined by the decisions you make along the way. You can add toppings or not, 
                and you can choose to eat the cereal right away or let it sit. These decisions determine which steps are executed and in 
                what order.</p>
              
              <p>Loops are a type of control flow that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times. An example of a loop in everyday 
              life is folding laundry. The loop would be:</p>
              
              <ol>              
                <li>Pick up a piece of clothing.</li>
                <li>Fold the clothing.</li>
                <li>Put the folded clothing in the appropriate pile (e.g. shirts, pants, socks).</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 1-3 for each piece of clothing until all the laundry is folded.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>In this example, the loop is repeated for each piece of clothing until all the laundry is folded. This allows you to perform
               the same set of instructions multiple times without having to write them out separately for each item of clothing.</p>

            <h2>Javascript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2> 
            <p>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are like the ingredients of a sandwich.<br>

              <br>HTML is the bread, the foundation of the sandwich. It provides the structure and content of the sandwich, such as the size, shape, and type 
              of bread used.<br>
              
              <br>CSS is like the condiments, seasonings, and toppings added to the sandwich to give it flavor, texture, and style. It enhances the visual 
              appearance of the sandwich, such as the color, font, and layout.<br>
              
              <br>JavaScript is like the filling, the substance that makes the sandwich complete. It adds interactivity and functionality to the sandwich, 
              such as the ability to customize or modify the sandwich based on user input or other events.</p>

            <h3>The DOM</h3>
              <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of the document 
                as a tree-like structure, with each node in the tree representing an element, attribute, or text node.<br>

                <br>In simpler terms, the DOM is a way for web developers to access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page using code.
                
                <br>Interacting with the DOM involves using JavaScript to select and manipulate elements on a web page. For example, you could use 
                JavaScript to change the text or color of a button, add or remove an element from the page, or listen for a user interaction like a 
                button click.<br>
                
                <br>To interact with the DOM, you first need to select the element you want to manipulate using JavaScript. This is typically done using a 
                method like document.getElementById() or document.querySelector(). Once you have a reference to the element, you can modify its 
                properties or add event listeners to respond to user interactions.</p>
